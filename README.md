# Keychain
Simple keychain which is modeled in Rhinoceros7 and 3d printed  

## task  

This is a training task for modeling a simple keychain and then printing on a 3D printer  

## materials and methods  

rhinoceros 7, pla filament, 3d printer - Prusa mk 3s  

## create a model  

by using simple commands:  
line, curve, extudeCRV, cap, circle

## analysis  

This was the first experience of successful modeling of a 3D printed object. it was successful. I also met a new 3d printer for the first time, and PRUSA turned out to be really convenient to work with.  

the not very satisfactory appearance of the finished product was due to the fact that I did not know which nozzle we would use to print and skip this figure. slicing was also performed by the teacher. to account for these errors in the future, I will check the future printed model in the slicer and, if necessary, scale it. probably, for some models, you will also have to take into account not only the possibility of 3D printing (and its very appearance), but also the thickness of the layer
